# Bank-Analytics end to end Project
Objective:

➡ This is Bank loan of Customers project where we were provided with 2 datasets with .csv extension files having 39k rows each and the objective was to analyze the growth that bank got within given years in loans.

➡ We used MS-Excel, MySQL for analyzing, cleaning and removing duplicates from dataset and prepared dashboard using Tableau and PowerBI tools where we did calculations, merging and prepared interactive dashboards.

KPI 1:Year wise loan amount Stats

➡ It is observed that the Loan Amount is increasing year by year.


➡ Starting 2007 loan amount has raised from 22,19,275 to 26,05,06,575 by year 2011. 

➡ Loan amount issue has raised more than 90% over the last 4 years Total loan issued 44,56,02,650

KPI2:Grade and sub grade wise revolving Balance

➡ Comparing Grade and subgrade wise revolving balance we can notice Grade-B have more revolving balance then any other grade & Grade-G have very low revolving balance.

➡ As we can see that Grade B customers has higher annual income for 10+ years of employment period, so higher the annual income lower the Debt to income ratio and hence, ➡ 

➡ more number of customers took loan in Grade B .

➡ Similarly, it goes for other grades too B>A>C>D>E>F>G order for revolving Balance as per annual income

KPI3:Total Payment for Verified Vs  Non Verified Status

➡ This is the first stage of the verification process. The bank needs a loan application to initiate the document collection and verification process.

➡ Used Donut chart(since we are using categorical Variables) we can observe that 59 % of loans are verified and 41% are not verified.

KPI4:State wise and month wise loan status

➡ It is Observed that CA states has more loans which got paid on time followed by FL. 

➡ CA state is also higher loans getting charged off.

KPI5:Home ownership vs last payment date:

➡ Used Tree maps to see how much % of customers paying debt on last date.

➡ Here, we can see that maximum customers who paid on last date was Renters(47.59%) followed by Mortgage(44.39%).

➡ Owners who owned houses are paying loans in time before the due date and its is approximately 7.37% as per info available.
